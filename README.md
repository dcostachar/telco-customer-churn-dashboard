# Telco Customer Churn Dashboard: Visualizing Data for Retention Solutions

Reducing customer churn is essential for businesses, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By understanding the key drivers of churn, companies can develop strategies to improve customer satisfaction, retention, and profitability. In this project, I used the Telco Customer Churn dataset (IBM sample data) from Kaggle and built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to provide a comprehensive view of the factors influencing churn in the telecommunications industry. Leveraging the insights gained, I developed actionable recommendations to guide focused retention strategies and improve customer loyalty.
