    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Reducing customer churn is essential for businesses, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than
      acquiring new ones. By understanding the key drivers of churn, companies can develop strategies to improve
      customer satisfaction, retention, and profitability.</p>
    <p>Using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data">Telco Customer Churn
        dataset</a> (IBM sample data) from Kaggle, this project aims to build an interactive dashboard that provides a
      clear view of the factors contributing to customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The insights gained
      will enable businesses to make data-driven decisions that enhance retention efforts and reduce churn.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Business Task</h2>
    <p>Create a dashboard that helps decision-makers analyze churn patterns, understand the main causes of churn, and
      identify at-risk customer segments. Based on the insights gained, produce actionable recommendations to inform
      focused retention strategies and improve customer loyalty.</p>

                    churned.

                    As tenure increases, churn rates drop significantly. Customers with more than 10 years of tenure

                    There is a slight rise in churn for customers in the 60-65 year range, which may warrant further

                    commitment to the company.</li>
                  <li><strong>Personalized offers:</strong> Once customers are identified as at-risk, provide tailored

                    values their loyalty.</li>
                  <li><strong>Proactive customer support:</strong> Provide dedicated support in the early stages of the
                    customer lifecycle. Frequent check-ins within the first few months can address issues before they
                    lead
                    to churn.</li>
                  <li><strong>Surveys and feedback loops:</strong> Regularly collect feedback from newer customers to
                    identify potential pain points early. Use this data to address common issues that may lead to
                    dissatisfaction and churn.</li>

                    contracts with discounted rates or added features. This can help lock in customers and reduce the
